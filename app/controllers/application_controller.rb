  # Its important that the location is NOT stored if:
  # - The request method is not GET (non idempotent)
  # - The request is handled by a Devise controller such as Devise::SessionsController as that could cause an
  #    infinite redirect loop.
  # - The request is an Ajax request as this can lead to very unexpected behaviour.
  # - The request is not a Turbo Frame request ([turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/blob/main/app/controllers/turbo/frames/frame_request.rb))
